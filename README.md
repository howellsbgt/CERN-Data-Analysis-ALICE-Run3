# ALICE Run-3 Strange Hadron Analysis
MSci Physics (University of Birmingham, 2024)

This repository contains the code and report from my final-year Master's project analysing K⁰s and Λ reconstruction efficiency in ALICE Run-3 data using ROOT and Python.

Originally developed between Sept 2023–May 2024 as part of my master’s thesis at CERN (ALICE experiment).  
Uploaded to GitHub in 2025 for public reference and portfolio purposes.

**Key achievements**
- Developed 98 % signal-retention V0 selection pipeline
- Real-time decision rate: 10 Hz
- Statistical significance improved via Monte-Carlo fits
