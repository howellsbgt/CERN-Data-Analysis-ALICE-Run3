# ALICE Run-3 Strange Hadron Analysis
MSci Physics (University of Birmingham, 2024)

This repository contains the code and report from my final-year Master's project analysing K‚Å∞s and Œõ reconstruction efficiency in ALICE Run-3 data using ROOT and Python.

Originally developed between Sept 2023‚ÄìMay 2024 as part of my master‚Äôs thesis at CERN (ALICE experiment).  
Uploaded to GitHub in 2025 for public reference and portfolio purposes.

### Project Goals:
- Reconstruct neutral V‚Å∞ particles from their charged decay products.
- Apply optimised selection cuts to maximise signal purity.
- Calculate detector reconstruction efficiencies using Monte Carlo simulations.
- Correct the measured spectra and compute the Œõ/K‚Å∞<sub>S</sub> baryon-to-meson ratio.

### Key achievements
- Developed ~90 % signal-retention V0 selection pipeline.
- Statistical significance improved via Monte-Carlo fits.
- Successfully obtained efficiency-corrected particle spectra and ratios.

## Key Results

### Œõ/K‚Å∞<sub>S</sub> Ratio
<p align="center"> <img src="plots/Corrected_Spectra/Corrected_Baryon_to_Meson_ratio.png" width="55%"><br> <em>Run 3 data give a mid-p‚Çú ratio ‚âà 0.3, lower than Run 2 (~0.6), hinting at reconstruction or calibration effects.</em> </p>

### Corrected Spectra

## Data Analysis
### Workflow:
1. Event Reconstruction
Identify V‚Å∞ candidates by implementing threshold cuts on five different parameters.

2. Cut Optimisation
Compute significance:
Scan each cut parameter to find the maximum significance.
Retain ‚â• 90 % signal and ensure data/MC agreement ‚â§ 2 %.
Result: 86-89% total signal retention, background reduced by ~70 %.

3. Monte Carlo Efficiencies
Generate simulated pp collisions using ALICE MC framework.
Process events through detector geometry + reconstruction chain.
Compute efficiency = (reconstructed / generated) as function of p‚Çú.

4. Spectrum Correction & Ratio
Divide raw yields by efficiencies ‚Üí corrected p‚Çú spectra.
